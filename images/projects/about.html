<h2>About me</h2>
<p>The likelihood of you arriving on this page is most likely purely 
out of self-promotion but with the off-chance that isn't the case,
i will not be giving away any information that could be used to compromise my likelihood as i value my privacy.

more or so it is for now just another clichÃ© statement of existence for a technologically
interested/inclined person.
<br><br>
as per hobbies outside of the computing realm, i enjoy photography, graffiti and hiking
and to reflect that this current page mostly for now portrays said hobbies
