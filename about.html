<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I am in the process of developing employable skills, with a minimal background in hardware 
modifications through 3rd party software.
<br>
This page will update with a valid portfolio once I find a skillset worth marketing.

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>The likelihood that youwe stumbled upon this page is low, most likely as a result of self-promotion
 and as such for now my "About me"  page is going to be concise & respective of my privacy.
<br>
<br>
This page for now serves as more of a clichÃ© statement of its existence and will expand further on as needed, as this is just an 
initial revision.
<br>
<br>
As for interests & hobbies, I am an avid photographer of nature, murals and other priceless events that i come across on my most
 fond hobby which is hiking, unfortunately due to the nature of my employment i do not get to do this as much as id like to, but
i do combine it with this page when i get the chance to do so as the photos implemented here will display.
